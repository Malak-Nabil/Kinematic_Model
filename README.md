# Kinematic Model
This repository contains a kinematic model of a forward-moving car where the steering angle decays over time. The model is simulated using the Turtlesim node. The user provides the car velocity, the initial steering angle, and the time of simulation as inputs.

## Usage

### 1.Launch the Turtlesim simulation

    rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

### 2.Run the Kinematic Model Controller

    rosrun kinematic_model code.py

### 3.Provide the required inputs


Car velocity (linear speed)

Initial steering angle

Simulation time
